WAJID KHAN:

Selecting naive_bayes Machine Learning Model.

PROBLEM THAT WE FACED:

1.WAJID KHAN:

 It is little bit difficult  to implement naives_bayes with data cleaning.It take time to clean the empty rows and column .

## Muhammad Saim:
I have worked on Perceptron Model.

## Problem:
Took a while to clean the Data and to calculate accuracy.
## Solution:
I solved this  by Decreasing the number of features in the datasets.

## maryam naz
It classifies the data point on how its neighbor is classified grounded on the similarity measure of the before stored data points. It take alot of time to train a model.

## Mustufa Shahid

I've chosen SVM machine learning model in this assignment.

Problem that I faced: For the new user,kaggle is difficult to use.So I faced some difficulty in using kaggle but later on I try to work on kaggle and submit prediction.
